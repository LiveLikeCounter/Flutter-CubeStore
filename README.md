# üî∂ Flutter Cube Store App (Neomorphism-style)

The design of this App is based on the Uplabs-design of *Rudi Hartono*, who has made this nice [Uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/cube-store-app-freebies) design.

The Flutter source is focused on the design of the app, which has a so called Neomorphism style. There is no statemanagement or such.

I hope you enjoy and can take something new from here!
